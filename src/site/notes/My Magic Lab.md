# Welcome

Welcome to my lab. This is where I write the tiny experiments I'm working on. The experiments are aimed at creating magical life experiences in general..

The idea of calling this a lab was inspired by the book, "tiny experiments" by Anne-Laure Le Cunff.

In her book, Anne-Laure Le Cunnf talks about developing an experimental mindset to life.

As part of creating a magical life, I am interested in improving productivity in as many ways as possible. This involves leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a research assistant to research and summarise research papers on the multitude of subjects that are out there.
